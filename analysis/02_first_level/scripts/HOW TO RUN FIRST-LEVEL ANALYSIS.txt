HOW TO RUN FIRST-LEVEL ANALYSIS

Run batch_1stLevel.sh in the terminal
Within this script, you can define which steps you want to run:
- mounting a folder onto the network
- creating timing files for all the relevant fMRI events
- creating the nuisance regressors as control variables
- running the actual analysis: this requires the .fsf files, which include all the parameters to run the GLMs
- running the quality assessment: the results should be checked manually.
