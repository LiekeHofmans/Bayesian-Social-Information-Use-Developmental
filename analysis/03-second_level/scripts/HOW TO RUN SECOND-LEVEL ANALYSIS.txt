HOW TO RUN SECOND-LEVEL ANALYSIS

Run batch_2ndLevel.sh in the terminal
Within this script, you can define which steps you want to run:
- running the actual analysis: this requires the .fsf files, which include all the parameters to run the GLMs
- running the quality assessment: the results should be checked manually.
